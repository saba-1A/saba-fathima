Development Strategy
I separated the primary UI components into these modular versions to maintain a clean and scalable codebase. This prevents "code bloat" and ensures that the Custom Banner remains a clean controller file.

Initially, I thought about putting all the Navbar code into one single file. However, after seeing how the theme structure uses separate files for different parts, I decided to do the same. By following this professional style, I can keep my code organized, much cleaner, and easier to edit for each specific version.

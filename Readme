My Shopify Development Process & File Structure
Project Architecture
To keep the code clean and scalable, I used a modular approach. Instead of putting all the code into one giant file, I created "Controller" files that call specific "Snippets" based on the version or device being used.

1. Custom Banner Section

Core Controller: sections/custom-banner.liquid

Navigation Snippets: Separate files for PC (v1 & v2) and Mobile to ensure a clean UI.

Hero Snippets: Dedicated snippets for Full PC, 4K Ultra-Wide, and Mobile views.

2. Custom Product Grid

Core Controller: sections/custom-products.liquid

Grid Snippets: Divided into product-grid-v1, product-grid-v2, and product-grid-mobile.

Development Strategy
Since this was my first time using Shopify, I spent time researching Liquid and studying the theme's existing structure. Drawing from my experience with Craft CMS, I realized that separating code into snippets would prevent "code bloat." This makes the site easier to maintain and much faster to edit for specific devices.

Key Features Implemented
Fully Editable Content: As requested, all text (highlighted in red in the instructions) and product selections are fully editable via the Shopify Customizer.

Dynamic Popups: The product grid features a popup that dynamically pulls the name, price, description, and variants directly from the product data.

Vanilla JavaScript: All interactive elements, including button animations and the Add-to-Cart logic, were built using pure JavaScript (no jQuery).

Automatic "Gift" Logic: I implemented a custom script so that if a user adds a product with the "Medium" size and "Black" color to their cart, the "Soft Winter Jacket" is automatically added as well.

Functional Checkout: The Add-to-Cart system is fully functional, and the checkout button successfully directs users to the final payment page.

Summary
Even though I was new to Shopify, I learned a lot during this process. It was a fun challenge and definitely worth my time—thank you for giving me the opportunity to try this out!

Regarding the timeline, I noticed both 3 and 7 days mentioned in the instructions. To be safe and ensure I met all requirements promptly, I decided to stick to the 3-day deadline. I'm really happy with the progress I made in that window
